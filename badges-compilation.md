# My TypeScript Journey: Earned Badges üèÜ

## Badges Overview

Here is a collection of badges I earned from completing Microsoft Learn's TypeScript modules:

1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-gb/petruse4ka/3RLRQKQH?sharingId=73745488D4967A12)
2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-gb/petruse4ka/P5Z5NDZ4?sharingId=73745488D4967A12)

## Reflections

1. In the 1st module I have learned how TypeScript is related to JavaScript, how to install the Typescript compiler in IDE and how to compile TS files into JS files. That module helped me to understand the benefits of using Typescript (such as catching errors early and making the codebase more maintainable) and see the flaws of Javascript, especially when working on large projects in big teams.
2. In the second module, I learned about various types, including primitive and object types, enums, any, unknown. This module deepened my understanding of TypeScript by introducing types not present in JavaScript. Learning about the any and unknown types was particularly interesting, as it showed me how to handle situations where types are not known in advance, for instance when you work with 3rd party code.The module also taught me about union and intersection types, which are useful for handling variables that can hold multiple types or can have only specific values. In real-world scenarios, the knowledge of these types is crucial. For example, in a complex application, using enums can make the code more readable and and error-proof, by letting the developers know in advance what type of variables they are working with.
